  The materials and methods in this repository support work
  towards developing the S.T.A.R.S healthcare framework
  (Sharing Tools and Artifacts for Reuable Simulations in
  healthcare).  The code and written materials re
  demonstrate the application of S.T.A.R.S' version 1 to
  sharing a `simpy` discrete-event simulation model and
  associated research artifacts.
